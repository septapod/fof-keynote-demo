## Recent Major Updates (v2.0 - Web3 Redesign)

### 1. âœ… UI/UX Overhaul - Web3 Aesthetic

**Color Palette Transformation:**
- Replaced purple-dominant theme with cyan/teal/blue web3 palette
- Primary: Neon Cyan (#06B6D4 â†’ #14B8A6)
- Secondary: Electric Blue (#3B82F6 â†’ #2563EB)
- Tertiary: Bright Cyan (#22D3EE â†’ #67E8F9)
- Backgrounds: Deep slate blue tones (#020617, #0F172A, #1E293B)

**Design System:**
- Implemented glassmorphism effects on all panels
- Added neon glows to key elements (cyan-focused)
- Reduced border radius by ~50% for sharper, modern look
- Custom gradient buttons replacing broken Material Web Components

### 2. âœ… Typography Optimization

**Scaled for Projection:**
- Reduced all text sizes ~33-40% to fit content properly
- h1: 84px â†’ 56px
- h2: 64px â†’ 44px
- Body: 32px â†’ 22px
- Maintained readability for CEO audiences sitting 30+ feet away

### 3. âœ… Chat Interface Redesign

**Realistic Messaging Experience:**
- Added avatar icons (ðŸ¤– for AI, "S" for Sarah)
- Implemented proper message rows with left/right alignment
- Uniform font size (15px) across all bubbles
- White AI messages (left), blue user messages (right)
- Reduced bubble radius: 18px â†’ 10px for modern look

**Enhanced Success Message:**
- Increased visibility of "$1,200.00 deposited" message
- Stronger green background (opacity 0.15 â†’ 0.25)
- Full 2px border (was left-only)
- Larger font (15px â†’ 17px) with semi-bold weight
- This is the climax of Act 5 - now properly emphasized

### 4. âœ… Accuracy Improvements for CEO Audience

**Fixed Banking Claims:**
- **Traditional funding comparison:** Changed from misleading "1-3 DAYS via ACH" to accurate "CLOSED - Earliest Monday 9 AM"
  - Real issue: Weekend/after-hours availability, not ACH speed
  - For internal loans, funding is same-day after approval
- **NCUA insurance disclosure:** Clarified that stablecoin settlement happens off-chain, but deposited funds ARE NCUA insured
- **Approval language:** Changed "instant approval" to "automated approval decisions" (no guarantee implied)
- **Cost claims:** Removed misleading $25 wire fee comparison

**Technical Accuracy:**
- 42 seconds total time (defensible with AI + blockchain)
- 30 seconds stablecoin settlement (conservative estimate)
- Open Banking data access (CFPB regulated)
- All claims are CEO-proof and defensible

### 5. âœ… Animation & Interaction Improvements

**Funding Animation:**
- Removed fake percentage counter (0%...100%)
- Replaced with instant "Funding complete" message
- Reduced delay from 1500ms to 800ms
- More accurate representation of blockchain settlement

**UI Polish:**
- Fixed double bullets in Act 6 competitive reality section
- Updated technology badges to full names: "Agentic AI, Open Banking, Stablecoins"
- Smoother transitions between acts
- Consistent spacing and alignment

### 6. âœ… Border Radius Reduction (Sharp & Sleek)

All corner radii reduced by 50% for modern aesthetic:
- Phone frame: 50px â†’ 24px
- Message bubbles: 18px â†’ 10px
- Small radius: 12px â†’ 6px
- Medium radius: 16px â†’ 8px
