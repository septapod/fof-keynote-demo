---

## Recent Major Updates (v3.1 - Tone & Messaging Refinement)

### 1. ✅ Research-Report Tone Refinement

**Updated Final Act Messaging:**
- Removed "The Integration Is the Innovation" section with glossy marketing language
- Replaced pushy call-to-action ("The question is whether you'll lead or follow") with informational messaging
- New message: "Credit unions implementing integrated AI + Open Banking + Stablecoin solutions can deliver immediate member value and competitive advantage."
- Changed "Competitive Reality" heading to "The Opportunity" for more neutral, research-oriented framing

**Rationale:**
- Demo now functions as research presentation, not sales pitch
- Provides information about solutions without pressure tactics
- More appropriate tone for CEO/board audiences evaluating strategic options
- Focus on value delivery rather than competitive urgency

### 2. ✅ Arrow Discovery Enhancement

**Added Pulsing Glow to Next Arrow:**
- Next arrow (▶) now has a flashing cyan glow effect when page first loads
- Glow pulses smoothly every 1.5 seconds for 8 seconds, then stops
- Uses consistent cyan color (#06B6D4) from design system
- Automatically removes animation to avoid distraction during presentation

**Benefits:**
- Helps users discover navigation arrow on first load
- Subtle but noticeable—improves initial UX without being distracting
- Perfect for live presentations where audience may miss UI elements
- Glow stops after 8 seconds so presenter controls pacing

- Eliminated ALL keyboard shortcuts (Space, R, 1-6, +/-, C)
- Gutted complex state management (isPlaying, isPaused, pausedSleepState, currentStep, etc.)
- Removed 10+ functions: play(), pause(), togglePlayPause(), jumpToAct(), runSequence(), etc.

**Code Reduction:**
- Before: ~1,050 lines of HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- After: ~650 lines of HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **38% code reduction** - dramatically simpler and more maintainable
