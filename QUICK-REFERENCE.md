## Pause Points (For Discussion)

**After Act 2:**
"Notice her perfect payment history was INVISIBLE to traditional lending. Open banking makes it visible."

**After Act 3:**
"Do you see the difference? Traditional banking would fail her on a Saturday night. Stablecoins solve it."

**After Act 5:**
"42 seconds. That's how long it took to change her life. How many Sarahs does your credit union turn away?"

**After Act 6:**
"The question isn't IF to build this. The question is WHEN."

## Opening Hook

"I want you to meet Sarah Martinez. She's a 34-year-old nurse. Single mother. Her car just broke down at 10:47 PM on Saturday. She needs $1,200 by Monday morning to get to work.

In the next 90 seconds, I'm going to show you how one credit union served her in ways that would blow your mind."

---

## Closing Statement

"You just watched a member in crisis get served by her credit union in ways that would have been impossible with traditional banking.

The question your board will ask isn't 'Should we build this?'

It's 'Can we afford NOT to?'

And the answer is: No. You can't."

---

## Common Q&A

**Q: Is this real?**
A: "The scenario is real. The technologies exist today. Some credit unions are already doing this."

**Q: How long to implement?**
A: "Pilots can start now. Full implementation: 6-12 months depending on your tech stack."

**Q: What about regulations?**
A: "Open banking is CFPB regulated. Stablecoins have GENIUS Act framework. All compliant."

**Q: What's the first step?**
A: "Talk to your technology team about AI + open banking integration. Start with one technology, layer in others."
