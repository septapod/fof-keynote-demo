## Your Opening (Read This)

"I want you to meet Sarah Martinez. She's 34, a nurse, single mother. Her car just broke down at 10:47 PM on Saturday night.

She needs $1,200 by Monday morning to get to work.

In the next 90 seconds, I'm going to show you how one credit union served her in ways that would be completely impossible with traditional banking."

## Critical Talking Points

### After Act 2
"Her perfect payment history was INVISIBLE to traditional lending. Open banking makes it visible."

### After Act 3
"Traditional: 3-5 days. Stablecoins: 30 seconds. That's the difference between Sarah keeping her job and losing it."

### After Act 5
"42 seconds. How many Sarahs does your credit union turn away every week?"

### After Act 6
"The question isn't whether to build this. The question is whether you'll lead or follow."
