## Presenter Tips

### Opening Hook
"I want you to meet Sarah Martinez. She's a 34-year-old nurse. Single mother. Her car just broke down at 10:47 PM on Saturday. She needs $1,200 by Monday morning to get to work. In the next 90 seconds, I'm going to show you how one credit union served her in ways that would be completely impossible with traditional banking."

### Key Moments
- **After Act 2:** "Her perfect payment history was INVISIBLE to traditional lending. Open banking makes it visible."
- **After Act 3:** "Traditional: 3-5 days. Stablecoins: 30 seconds. That's the difference between Sarah keeping her job and losing it."
- **After Act 5:** "42 seconds. How many Sarahs does your credit union turn away every week?"

### Closing
"The question isn't whether to build this. The question is whether you'll lead or follow. Your members expect this now. Fintech and large banks are already building it."
